## 📖 Introduction

Controlling the speed of a DC motor is a key requirement in many household and industrial applications such as fans, mixers, pumps, and sewing machines. This project presents a simple and effective circuit to regulate motor speed using a **MOSFET** and a **potentiometer**. By adjusting the resistance, we can vary the voltage supplied to the motor, thereby controlling its speed.
